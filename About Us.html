            <h3><strong>History OF abacus</strong></h3>
            
            <p> The word abacus dates to at least AD 1387 when a Middle English work borrowed the word from latin that described a sandboard abacus. 
                The Latin word is derived from ancient greek ἄβαξ (abax) which means something without a base, and colloquially, any piece of rectangular material.

            <h3><strong>Abacus in India</strong></h3>
            <p>The Abhidharmakośabhāṣya of Vasubandhu (316-396), a Sanskrit work on Bhuddist philosophy, 
              says that the second-century CE philosopher Vasumitra said that "placing a wick (Sanskrit vartikā) on the number one (ekāṅka) means 
              it is a one while placing the wick on the number hundred means it is called a hundred, 
              and on the number one thousand means it is a thousand". It is unclear exactly what this arrangement may have been. 
              Around the 5th century, Indian clerks were already finding new ways of recording the contents of the abacus.
              Hindu texts used the term śūnya (zero) to indicate the empty column on the abacus.
